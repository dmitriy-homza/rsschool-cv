### Summary
From childhood, computers and everything connected with them attracted me with their capabilities and pure logic. Unfortunately, for medical reasons, I could not enter the relevant university, so I graduated from the medical faculty :)

While working, I realized that I want to work where I want, so I am extremely interested and motivated by everything that requires my mental abilities, and I am completely confident in them.

Now my main goal is to get the knowledge necessary to solve problems in the work of an experienced developer.

### My skills:

* **JavaScript**
* **Git**
* **SVG**
